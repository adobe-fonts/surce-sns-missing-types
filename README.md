# Surce Sns Missing Types

[Adobe] and [American Red Cross] have collaborated this year to create these exclusive fonts for the [Missing Types] campaign running from June 11 â€“ June 30, 2019. These fonts symbolize the importance of A, B and O blood types missing by replacing those letters in the typeface with a blood drop.
